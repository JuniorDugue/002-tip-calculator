# Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

# Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.




# will return an error because of the len function 
num_char = len(input("what's your name?"))

# print("your name has " + num_char + " characters.")



# you can verify a data type using type function e.g.
print(type(num_char)) # -> <class 'int'>
