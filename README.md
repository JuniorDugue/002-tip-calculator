#### notes
![len() error](/assets/len_error.jpg)
- we can use len() on string, not numbers/integers
- if we wanted to use len() on integers, we'd have to add quotes/double quotes around the numbers e.g. `print(len(12345))` -> 5

![printing 1st character of a string](/assets/1st_character.jpg)
- 'subscripting'
